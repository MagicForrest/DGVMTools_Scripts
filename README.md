# DGVMTools_Scripts

A few examples scripts for running DGVMTools on your own data.  These can be used for learning the package, and also developed 
into useful analysis scripts in their own right.

Also check out vignette included in the package, this is the standard R way to offer detailed documentation for packegs. Also
look at the function-by-function examples available in R with `example("<function_name>")`.  At time of writing the vignettes are 
fairly complete, but some functions are missing examples.
